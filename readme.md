Stall
=========
### Small, silly games tied to physical locations.
-------------------

Stall is an app for small games that become playable at specific locations. 

Our games last about 15-20 seconds. What kind of place do we spent 15-20 seconds with our phone?

Introducing **Stall**. Play silly games and get the high score. You'll be famous!

------------

Games become playable when you find a Stall QR code anywhere (on campus, in your apartment, in the airport). If you stumble upon a Stall QR location, simply open the app, scan the code and you're instantly pulled into that game.  

The game is different at every location, and highscore glory is available for each game as well as for your aggregate score across all of them.

Created for the Computer Engineering Club's Student Hackathon at the University of Alberta.
